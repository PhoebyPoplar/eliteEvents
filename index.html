            <h1>10</h1>
            <h4>User 1 (Meng)</h4>
            <h5>Some of the group had family and friends test the user 
                ability of the app through the prototype to see what 
                needed to be improved or fixed. We considered everything 
                they mentioned in their feedback so that our app would be successful.</h5>
            <h5>Bottom navigations is confusing..the button icons are not matched
                 with what actual icons are. For example, the plus icon, “+” , 
                 I thought it was for adding something or creating a draft but It 
                 brought me to the event feature screen. The bottom navigations 
                 should be more organized and clear indications!</h5>
            <h4>User 2 (Phoeby)</h4>
            <h5>The pages seem to be very plain and boring. The colors look 
                nice but wish it had more going on with imagery. The profile 
                button doesn’t take me to any profile page, it doesn’t do anything. 
                The hamburger pop-up seems too long with empty space.
            </h5>
            <h5>Wish the app showed me options to choose from of which kind 
                events I can create for example, birthday parties, weddings, 
                anniversaries, etc. It’s very confusing what kind of events 
                the app is towards, going to already made events or to create my own event/party.
            </h5>
            <h5>The app needs a better indicator of what kind of events it was 
                intended for, maybe put that as a screen to choose an option. 
                Needs more design elements to enchase the design.
            </h5>
            <h4>User 3 (Shanru)</h4>
            <h5>The bottom navigation is too close for easy access with 
                one hand and one thumb. If the navigation is separated by 
                a certain distance, I think this problem can be avoided.
            </h5>
            <h5>If the Event feature and Memories feature pages were originally 
                designed in this way, it is recommended to use some kind of 
                scroll bar to indicate, because the picture on this page only 
                shows half of the content, it is easy for users to feel the 
                absence of content and begin to lose interest in it.
            </h5>
            <h4>User 4 (Melanie)</h4>
            <h5>For the bottom of quick button, can show animation when touch, 
                also use different color to show the current feature of icon. 
                Make sure every page of home button link to home page.</h5>
